**Salesforce**: 
- I am the Chief Architect for Financial Services & Insurance. I am responsible for the solution architecture for our products, working closely with key customers around the world. My primary focus is on integrating customer-facing CRM capabilitiesâ€”such as Sales, Marketing, Onboarding, and Servicing (Contact Center) with Data, Predictive and Generative AI platforms. 
- In this role, my team partners with our key Financial Services customers (globally) to understand their key CRM/Data/AI implementations, map out current-state and target state architecture, identify challenges and opportunities, and design 6-18 month roadmaps. We work to optimize the implementation and integration of Salesforce technologies with core systems.
- With aa specific focus on Data & AI/GenAI, I understand the current capabilities/architecture of the entire enterprise, with a specific emphasis on Data & AI platforms, and layout a target state architecture of how predictive & Generative AI, particularly Agents, capabilities can be leveraged to power the customer and colleague facing experiences. 
- In addition to Retail & Commercial Banking, Payments, I am currently focusing a lot on Wealth Management, Investment Banking, Capital Markets, Insurance & Fintech.
- As the voice of the customer, I amplify their needs, becoming the connective tissue between customers and the  multiple Salesforce product teams, helping shape our product development and integration strategies.
- I joined Salesforce as I wanted to contribute and fast learn about other Financial Services (outside of retail banking/financial services, payments, card network, merchant services, loyalty - which I am a true expert of) but I wanted learn Private Equity, Capital Markets, Investment Banking and other regulated industries (Life Sciences, Healthcare - given my desire to contribute in medicine and my experience at IQVIA) a lot.

**JPMorgan Chase**: 
- Prior to this role, I used to run Data, AIML Architecture, Strategy & Engineering at Chase. This was my second innings at Chase (during my first one 2003-06,  I was involved in largest FS merger of Bank One & JPMC, Online Banking, Payments, Middleware, Channel Convergence etc..)

**IQVIA**:
- Before joining Chase, I ran the Architecture, AI/ML and UI/UX Design team at IQVIA (R&D) and was keenly involved in running Clinical Trial platforms for several sponsors (in context of COVID Vaccine trails) and other aspects of the R&D capabilities.

**American Express**: 
- I spent 14 years at American Express running architecture for several businesses/units including Global Commercial Payments, Marketing, Customer 360, Customer Acquisitions, Global Credit & Fraud Risk Management, Salesforce, AskAmex, Big Data & AI/ML Platform capabilities etc.
- I also supported the technology due diligence for many M&A/Strategic Investments, working with startups like Stripe, iZettle, etc. and acquisitions of adjacent capabilities (Loyalty Partner - collation loyalty, P2P/Mobile Payments - fraud risk management - accertify, Resy & Cake Technologies - premium dining, LoungeBuddy - airport lounges).
- I was the technical lead of the spinoff of American Express Business Travel. I worked with several adjacent mobile payments players in China, India and Europe. AmEx was an early adopter of Big Data (Hadoop technologies) and I have been engaged in productionalizing Data/ML capabilities at scale since 2009 or so when we implemented our first set of ML models (Random Forrests, gradient boosting, etc...)

**Focus Areas** 
- **Data/AI/ML/GenAI**: I have had a deep passion in applying Data/AI/ML/GenAI/Agents experience on medicine, thats why I joined IQVIA, and enjoyed my time supporting bringing COVID vaccines to market in record time... but then realized that the company was a relatively slow moving and rather not aggressive (in-terms of investments) organization without the urgency of COVID... I wrote this LinkedIn post after I left IQVIA. 
- **Security**: I guess having worked in FINS, Life Sciences I am fairly intense on security. In addition to my usual "Chief Architect" roles for the businesses that I supported, I always used to play a "CISO" type role for my extended teams... :slightly_smiling_face: Learnt a lot from interacting closely with my CISOs and thoroughly enjoyed learning/sharing...
- **Patents**: Have several granted many patents in the world of eCommerce, mobile payments etc.
- **Mentor**: Very passionate about learning/teaching, particualarly Women in Computing after my experiences attending Grace Hopper Conference and interacting with my daughter and her circle of friends...
- **Author**: Published a couple of books (Special Edition using Java Beans and Microsoft .NET KickStart) and used to run XML Journal and chaired conferences in XML, Web Services, Telephony, Mobile during 1996-2001. I would love to write more...
- **IIT Kanpur**: Graduated from IIT Kanpur in 1996, in Chemical Engineering & Computer Science and have recently become quite active in Pan IIT alumni network.
