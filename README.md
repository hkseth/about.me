## Salesforce
- As Chief Architect for Financial Services & Insurance, I am responsible for the solution architecture for our products, working closely with key customers around the world. My primary focus is on integrating customer-facing CRM capabilities—such as Sales, Marketing, Onboarding, and Servicing (Contact Center) with Data, AI/ML and GenAI/Agent platforms. 
- Partner with our key Financial Services customers (globally) to understand their key CRM/Data/AI implementations, map out current-state and target state architecture, identify challenges and opportunities, and design 6-18 month roadmaps. We work to optimize the implementation and integration of Salesforce technologies with core systems.
- Engage with senior leaders of our largest/most-complex customers to map out their current and planned investments to ensure that they have an aggressive but achievable roadmap that drives business value in the core CRM capabilities - Sales, Servicing, Marketing, built on a foundation of hetrogenous Data & AI/ML platforms.
- With a specific focus on Data & AI/GenAI/Agents, understand the current capabilities/architecture of the entire enterprise, with a specific emphasis on Data & AI platforms, and layout a target state architecture of how predictive & Generative AI, particularly Agents, capabilities can be leveraged to power the customer and colleague facing experiences.
- In addition to the "core" Retail & Commercial Banking, Payments, currently focusing a lot on applying Agentic AI and data platforms to create the next generation customer experiences in Wealth Management, Investment Banking, Capital Markets, Insurance & Fintech.
- As the voice of the customer, I amplify their needs, becoming the connective tissue between customers and the  multiple Salesforce product teams, helping shape our product development and integration strategies.
- Work closely with Salesforce Ventures teams for investing, acquisition and integration of startups/Fintechs to shape the product and partner ecosystem integrqtion roadmap. 
- Joined Salesforce as I wanted to contribute and fast learn about other Financial Services (outside of retail banking/financial services, payments, card network, merchant services, loyalty - which I am a true expert of) but I wanted learn Private Equity, Capital Markets, Investment Banking and other regulated industries.
- I have a deep passion in applying Data/AI/ML experience on medicine, thats why I joined IQVIA, and enjoyed my time supporting bringing COVID vaccines to market in record time... but then realized that the company was a relatively slow moving and rather not aggressive (in-terms of investments) organization without the urgency of COVID... I wrote this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hiteshseth_thankyou-activity-6969720217895628801-4Ov4/) after I left IQVIA.
