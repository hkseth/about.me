**TL;DR**;
- I am laser-focused on getting CRM (Sales, Servicing, Marketing) Agentic capabilities, built on a Data & AI foundation, live at scale in production within the largest/complex customers in regulated industries - Financial Services & Insurance, and to some extent Life Sciences & Healthcare.
  
**Salesforce**: 
- As Chief Architect for Financial Services & Insurance, I am responsible for the solution architecture for our products, working closely with key customers around the world. My primary focus is on integrating customer-facing CRM capabilities—such as Sales, Marketing, Onboarding, and Servicing (Contact Center) with Data, AI/ML and GenAI/Agent platforms. 
- Partner with our key Financial Services customers (globally) to understand their key CRM/Data/AI implementations, map out current-state and target state architecture, identify challenges and opportunities, and design 6-18 month roadmaps. We work to optimize the implementation and integration of Salesforce technologies with core systems.
- Engage with senior leaders of our largest/most-complex customers to map out their current and planned investments to ensure that they have an aggressive but achievable roadmap that drives business value in the core CRM capabilities - Sales, Servicing, Marketing, built on a foundation of hetrogenous Data & AI/ML platforms.
- With a specific focus on Data & AI/GenAI/Agents, understand the current capabilities/architecture of the entire enterprise, with a specific emphasis on Data & AI platforms, and layout a target state architecture of how predictive & Generative AI, particularly Agents, capabilities can be leveraged to power the customer and colleague facing experiences.
- In addition to the "core" Retail & Commercial Banking, Payments, currently focusing a lot on applying Agentic AI and data platforms to create the next generation customer experiences in Wealth Management, Investment Banking, Capital Markets, Insurance & Fintech.

- Work closely with Salesforce Ventures teams for investing, acquisition and integration of startups/Fintechs to shape the product and partner ecosystem integrqtion roadmap. 
- Joined Salesforce as I wanted to contribute and fast learn about other Financial Services (outside of retail banking/financial services, payments, card network, merchant services, loyalty - which I am a true expert of) but I wanted learn Private Equity, Capital Markets, Investment Banking and other regulated industries (Life Sciences, Healthcare - given my desire to contribute in medicine and my experience at IQVIA) a lot.

**Technology Focus Areas** 
- **Data/AI/ML/GenAI/Agent Frameworks**: I’m deeply passionate about modern data platforms, data architecture and engineering, and the transformative power of AI/ML, GenAI, and agent-based systems. I’ve applied this expertise in highly complex and regulated industries such as financial services and medicine.

From early in my career, I’ve specialized in connecting internal and external platforms using a wide range of integration technologies—including CORBA, SOAP, REST, APIs, GraphQL, MQ, message/event-driven frameworks, Kafka, etc. My approach blends architectural rigor with practical execution to ensure systems interoperability, resilience, and scale.
