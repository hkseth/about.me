# Hitesh Seth

TLDR;
- These days, I am laser focused on getting Agents (of course with a core foundation of Data and Integrations - APIs/MCPs) live at scale in production with Regulated Industries (while I focus primarily today on Financial Services & Insurance), I would love to contribute again to Life Sciences & Healthcare. 

**Salesforce**: 
- I am the Chief Architect for Financial Services & Insurance. I am responsible for the solution architecture for our products, working closely with key customers around the world. My primary focus is on integrating customer-facing CRM capabilities—such as Sales, Marketing, Onboarding, and Servicing (Contact Center) with Data, AI/ML and GenAI/Agent platforms. 
- In this role, my team partners with our key Financial Services customers (globally) to understand their key CRM/Data/AI implementations, map out current-state and target state architecture, identify challenges and opportunities, and design 6-18 month roadmaps. We work to optimize the implementation and integration of Salesforce technologies with core systems.
- With a specific focus on Data & AI/GenAI/Agents, I understand the current capabilities/architecture of the entire enterprise, with a specific emphasis on Data & AI platforms, and layout a target state architecture of how predictive & Generative AI, particularly Agents, capabilities can be leveraged to power the customer and colleague facing experiences.
- In addition to Retail & Commercial Banking, Payments, I am currently focusing a lot on applying Agentic AI and data platforms to create the next generation customer experiences in Wealth Management, Investment Banking, Capital Markets, Insurance & Fintech.
- As the voice of the customer, I amplify their needs, becoming the connective tissue between customers and the  multiple Salesforce product teams, helping shape our product development and integration strategies.
- I work closely with Salesforce Ventures teams for investing, acquisition and integration of startups/Fintechs to shape the product and partner ecosystem integrqtion roadmap. 
- I joined Salesforce as I wanted to contribute and fast learn about other Financial Services (outside of retail banking/financial services, payments, card network, merchant services, loyalty - which I am a true expert of) but I wanted learn Private Equity, Capital Markets, Investment Banking and other regulated industries (Life Sciences, Healthcare - given my desire to contribute in medicine and my experience at IQVIA) a lot.

**JPMorgan Chase**: 
- Prior to this role, I used to run Data, AIML Architecture, Strategy & Engineering at Chase, responsible for End-to-End architecture, technology strategy, and cloud-native transformation and migration for Chase
Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) Data Platforms and products. This integrated suite of products is the core foundation of multiple product lines including, Consumer Banking, Small Business Banking, Credit Cards, Connected Commerce, Auto Finance, Home Finance, and Chase Wealth Management.
- Responsible for the development of key products for data ingestion, transformation, processing, warehousing, stream ingestion, and stream processing capabilities across CCB.
- This was my second innings at Chase (during my first one 2003-06,  I was involved in largest FS merger of Bank One & JPMC, Online Banking, Payments, Middleware, Channel Convergence etc..)

**IQVIA**:
- I ran the Architecture, AI/ML and UI/UX Design team at IQVIA (R&D) and was keenly involved in running Clinical Trial platforms for several sponsors (in context of COVID Vaccine trails) and other aspects of the R&D capabilities.

**American Express**: 
- I spent 14 years at American Express running architecture for several businesses/units including Global Commercial Payments, Marketing, Customer 360, Customer Acquisitions, Global Credit & Fraud Risk Management, Salesforce, AskAmex, Big Data & AI/ML Platform capabilities etc.
- I also supported the technology due diligence for many M&A/Strategic Investments, working with startups like Stripe, iZettle, etc. and acquisitions of adjacent capabilities (Loyalty Partner - collation loyalty, P2P/Mobile Payments - fraud risk management - Accertify, Resy & Cake Technologies - premium dining, LoungeBuddy - airport lounges).
- I was the technical lead of the spinoff of American Express Business Travel. I worked with several adjacent mobile payments players in China, India and Europe. AmEx was an early adopter of Big Data (Hadoop technologies) and I have been engaged in productionalizing Data/ML capabilities at scale since 2009 or so when we implemented our first set of ML models (Random Forrests, gradient boosting, etc...)

**Focus Areas** 
- **Data/AI/ML/GenAI/Agent Frameworks**: I’m deeply passionate about modern data platforms, data architecture and engineering, and the transformative power of AI/ML, GenAI, and agent-based systems. I’ve applied this expertise in highly complex and regulated industries such as financial services and medicine.
- **Integration**: I’ve long championed the power of integrated systems to solve complex, large-scale challenges. From early in my career, I’ve specialized in connecting internal and external platforms using a wide range of integration technologies—including CORBA, SOAP, REST, APIs, GraphQL, MQ, message/event-driven frameworks, Kafka, etc. My approach blends architectural rigor with practical execution to ensure systems interoperability, resilience, and scale.
- **Security**: I guess having worked in FINS, Life Sciences I am fairly intense on security. In addition to my usual "Chief Architect" roles for the businesses that I supported, I always used to play a "CISO" type role for my extended teams... :slightly_smiling_face: Learnt a lot from interacting closely with my CISOs and thoroughly enjoyed learning/sharing...
- **Patents**: Have several granted many patents in the world of eCommerce, mobile payments etc.
- **Mentor**: Very passionate about learning/teaching, particualarly Women in Computing after my experiences attending Grace Hopper Conference and interacting with my daughter and her circle of friends...
- **Author**: Published a couple of books (Special Edition using Java Beans and Microsoft .NET KickStart) and used to run XML Journal and chaired conferences in XML, Web Services, Telephony, Mobile during 1996-2001. I would love to write more...
- **IIT Kanpur**: Graduated from IIT Kanpur in 1996, in Chemical Engineering & Computer Science and have recently become quite active in Pan IIT alumni network.
