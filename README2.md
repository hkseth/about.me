### Salesforce: Chief Solution Architect (20024 - )
- As Chief Architect for Financial Services & Insurance, I am responsible for the solution architecture for our products, working closely with key customers around the world. My primary focus is on integrating customer-facing CRM capabilities—such as Sales, Marketing, Onboarding, and Servicing (Contact Center) with Data, AI/ML, and GenAI/Agent platforms. 
- Partner with our key Financial Services customers (globally) to understand their key CRM/Data/AI implementations, map out current-state and target state architecture, identify challenges and opportunities, and design 6-18 month roadmaps. We work to optimize the implementation and integration of Salesforce technologies with core systems.
- Engage with senior leaders of our largest/most-complex customers to map out their current and planned investments to ensure that they have an aggressive but achievable roadmap that drives business value in the core CRM capabilities - Sales, Servicing, Marketing, built on a foundation of heterogeneous Data & AI/ML platforms.
- With a specific focus on Data & AI/GenAI/Agents, understand the current capabilities/architecture of the entire enterprise, with a specific emphasis on Data & AI platforms, and lay out a target state architecture of how predictive & Generative AI, particularly Agents, capabilities can be leveraged to power the customer and colleague-facing experiences.
- In addition to the "core" Retail & Commercial Banking, Payments, currently focusing a lot on applying Agentic AI and data platforms to create the next generation customer experiences in Wealth Management, Investment Banking, Capital Markets, Insurance & Fintech.
- As the voice of the customer, I amplify their needs, becoming the connective tissue between customers and the  multiple Salesforce product teams, helping shape our product development and integration strategies.
- Work closely with Salesforce Ventures teams for investing, acquisition, and integration of startups/FinTech's to shape the product and partner ecosystem integration roadmap. 
- Joined Salesforce as I wanted to contribute and fast learn about other Financial Services (outside of retail banking/financial services, payments, card network, merchant services, loyalty - which I am a true expert of), but I wanted to learn Private Equity, Capital Markets, Investment Banking, and other regulated industries.
- I have a deep passion for applying Data/AI/ML experience on medicine, that's why I joined IQVIA, and enjoyed my time supporting bringing COVID vaccines to market in record time... but then realized that the company was a relatively slow-moving and rather not aggressive (in terms of investments) organization without the urgency of COVID... I wrote this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hiteshseth_thankyou-activity-6969720217895628801-4Ov4/) after I left IQVIA.

## Technology Focus Areas
- **Data/AI/ML/GenAI/Agentic Frameworks**: I’m deeply passionate about modern data platforms, data architecture and engineering, and the transformative power of AI/ML, GenAI, and agent-based systems. I’ve applied this expertise in highly complex and regulated industries such as financial services and medicine.
- **APIs & Integration**: I’ve long championed the power of integrated systems to solve complex, large-scale challenges. From early in my career, I’ve specialized in connecting internal and external platforms using a wide range of integration technologies—including CORBA, SOAP, REST, APIs, GraphQL, MQ, message/event-driven frameworks, Kafka, etc. My approach blends architectural rigor with practical execution to ensure systems interoperability, resilience, and scale.
- **Security**: I guess having worked in FINS, Life Sciences, I am fairly intense on security. In addition to my usual "Chief Architect" roles for the businesses that I supported, I always used to play a "CISO" type role for my extended teams... :slightly_smiling_face: Learnt a lot from interacting closely with my CISOs and thoroughly enjoyed learning/sharing...
